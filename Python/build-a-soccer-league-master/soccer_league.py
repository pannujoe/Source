"""Build a Soccer League - Treehouse Techdegree - Python Web Development

Partition player data from CSV file, into three teams, generate letters
to players guardians. See 'instructions.org' for grading rubric.

Each team is represented by a dict created by 'gen_team(name)'
    team = {'name': "", 'avg_height': 0, players=[]}
where,
   'name':  holds the name of the team,
   'avg_height':  is the average team height from the current players, and
   'players' is a list of dicts, where each player dict contains the
       information from CSV file

The Entire League is represented by a list of team dicts:
    entire_league = [team1, team2 ,team3]

The sorting algorithm works as follows:
    0. players are separated into two lists for experienced and new
    1. each player list is sorted by player height (tallest first)
    2. Loop:
        A. sort entire_league by avg team height (shortest first)
        B. Starting with tallest player, add one player to each team
        C. calculate new avg_height for each team
    3. The experienced players are added first, then the new players.

Program Output:
    1. 18 letters, one to each player's guardian(s), saved in a file named
        "player_<player_name>.txt"
    2. Bonus output: 3 team files, one for each team, summarizing the team
        information: Team name, practice time, average team height, player
        roster. Saved into a file named "<team_name>_roster.txt"
